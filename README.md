# vzp-i3-conifgs
Contains my i3 configs and setup scripts

So, working on updating to 4.10.2 on Kali and on straight debian so thought I would put my 
configurations, steps, dependency stuff here.

Used to have to temporarily add jessie sources to /etc/apt/sources.list but no longer thanks to recent updates by Debian.

Hopefully this is usefule to others, lessons any pain, etc.
